# 🌱 Biomass Prediction Project - Project Overview

## What This Project Does

This project demonstrates how to predict **biomass** (the total mass of living organisms in an area) using **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from satellite imagery. It's designed to be educational and beginner-friendly.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- **What it is**: A measure of vegetation health and density calculated from satellite imagery
- **Formula**: NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)
- **Range**: -1 to 1
- **Interpretation**:
  - -1 to 0: Water, snow, or barren land
  - 0 to 0.3: Sparse vegetation
  - 0.3 to 0.6: Moderate vegetation
  - 0.6 to 1: Dense, healthy vegetation

### Biomass
- **What it is**: Total mass of living organisms in a given area
- **Units**: Usually measured in tons/hectare
- **Why it matters**: Important for agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring

### The Relationship
- **Higher NDVI** generally means **higher biomass**
- This makes sense: healthier, denser vegetation produces more living material
- The relationship isn't perfectly linear, but linear regression can capture the main trend
